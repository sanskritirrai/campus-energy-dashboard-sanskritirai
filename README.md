-- What is this project?
This is a Python program designed to analyze the energy usage of campus buildings. It uses data science tools (Pandas, Matplotlib) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to find out when and where the most energy is being consumed.

-- How it Works
Input: Reads all raw energy files from the ./data/ folder.

Clean: Combines the files, fixes errors, and makes sure all timestamps and energy numbers are correct.

Analyze: Calculates daily, weekly, and total energy use for every building.

Output: Saves the results and creates visual charts.

-- Outputs 
All final files are saved in the ./output/ folder:

dashboard.png: A picture showing the energy trends and comparisons between buildings.

summary.txt: A quick report listing the Total Campus Energy Use and the Highest Consuming Building.

.csv files: Clean tables of all the processed data and summary statistics.

In short, this system turns messy energy readings into clear answers and charts.
